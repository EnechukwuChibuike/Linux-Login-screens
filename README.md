#GDM is the GNOME Display Manager, a graphical login program that uses the X Window System.

In addition to being a GUI alternative to the console login prompt, GDM has the following advantages:

it pre-loads the X Window System (though this can be a disadvantage for servers)
users can select various desktop environments and windows managers on a per-login basis
assistance for users with disabilities
per-login regional settings and keyboard layout
consistent look and feel of other GTK/GNOME-themed applications
all other functionalities of XDM, including XDMCP support for managing remote displays
